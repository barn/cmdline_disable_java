Nerf Java on OSX on the command line
====================================

This merely disables the Java web plugin for use with Safari/FireFox and
Chrome.

If it can find the Oracle package, it disabled that. If it can find any
plugin at all, it disables that.

You _can_ easily turn it back on, but don't do that.
